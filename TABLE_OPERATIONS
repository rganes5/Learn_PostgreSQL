To create a new user in PostgreSQL:
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';

Grant all privileges to the new user on a specific database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO newuser;

CREATE TABLE:
CREATE TABLE table_name(column_name DATATYPE);

INSERT INTO TABLE:
INSERT INTO table_name(column_name) VALUES(value);

DISPLAY TABLE:
SELECT *FROM table_name;

DISPLAY TABLE WITH SPECIFIC:
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE Col_name=col_value;

ADD COLUMNS TO EXISTING TABLE:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN col_name DATATYPE, ADD COLUMN col_name DATATYPE;

ADD VALUES TO ALTERED COLUMNS IN EXISTING TABLE:
SET col_name = 'value', col_name = 'value'
WHERE table_id = id_number;

ORDER-BY:
SELECT *FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name ASC/DESC;
SELECT col_name FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name ASC/DESC;

DISTINCT:
SELECT DISTINCT col_name FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name;

WHERE:
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE col_name='criteria';
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE col_name1='criteria' AND (col_name2='criteria' OR col_name2='criteria');

LIMIT:
SELECT *FROM table_name LIMIT 14;

FETCH: 
//same as limit
SELECT *FROM table_name FETCH FIRST 10 ROW ONLY;

OFFSET:
SELECT *FROM table_name OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5;

IN: 
//takes in array of values and converts to query
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE col_name IN ('criteria1','criteria2','criteria3');

BETWEEN:
//USED DOB AS EXAMPLE
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE date_of_birth
BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-01-01';

LIKE:
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE email LIKE '%.com';
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE email LIKE '%google.%';
SELECT *FROM table_name WHERE email LIKE '_______@%';
SELECT *FROM person WHERE country LIKE 'P%';

GROUP-BY:
SELECT col_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY col_name;
// This will count the number of people by grouping countries eg: SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country;

GROUP-BY HAVING:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(*) >5 ORDER BY country;

HOW TO DELETE VALUE FROM A COLUMN IN POSTGRES:
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = NULL WHERE condition;
eg:UPDATE person SET car_id= NULL WHERE id=1;
