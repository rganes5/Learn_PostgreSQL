Here we will create a test database with all default settings.
CREATE DATABASE db_name;

Connect to DB
\c dbname

Rename a database: 
ALTER DATABASE db_name RENAME TO new_db_name;

View all database:
\l

Using SELECT statement:
SELECT db_name FROM pg_database;

Create new user:
CREATE ROLE new_user_name
VALID UNTIL 'infinity';

Change the owner:
ALTER DATABASE db_name OWNER TO user_name;
